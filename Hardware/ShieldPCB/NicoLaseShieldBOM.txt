Add sufficient male 0.1" headers to populate board (28 total). 

BNC sockets (BN35N61) are these are equivalent:

The OR gate (U1) used in implementation is 74HC1G32GW from NXP.  Important characteristics are CMOS logic levels (3v3), can run on 3v3 input power, and SOT-353 footprint.

Surface mount parts are chosen for a compact assembly.  While small, these have been successfully assembled using a standard temperature-controlled soldering iron and reel solder.  For those starting out with working with surface-mount parts, an excellent guide is available from SparkFun at https://www.sparkfun.com/tutorials/36. 

Edit added 12/12/2016 - The inputs to the OR gate require pull-down resistors for proper operation, especially if either is left unpopulated in the final assembly.  These have been added to the PCB design as R4 and R5.  10k ohm is appropriate for both.
