Heat sink mounts and other to-machine parts for NicoLase.

Each build requires a heat sink block to hold lasers.  Design iterations have generated different designs which are recorded here.  For each design, a PDF drawing and STEP file is included.  Others may include a rendering for illustration.    

There are currently three generations of design here:
- 1x00 - Original design.  1.5" beam height.  Single-mirror alignment and requires specialized fiber coupling mount pedistal for up to 6 lasers.
- 2x00 - Dual-mirror design. 1.5" beam height.  Supports up to 4 lasers and dual output.
- 3x00 - Improved dual-mirror design. 39.3 mm beam height.  Up to 6 lasers with dual-mirror alignment and standard hardware.

The 'x' in design refers to number of lasers included in design. Can make designs more compact by omitting positions in heat sink block or extend with more positions for even more lasers in a launch.  Excluding a laser position makes it easier to squeeze in accessory hardware, such as a speckle reducer.
